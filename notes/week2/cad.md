# Introduction to CAD

### Spatial Visualization

Spatial visualization means to visualize different orientations of 3D shapes.

### Mechanical Drawings

- Takes a 3D visualization to 2D
- Used for consistency and as an easy way to recreate 3D objects
- Mechanical drawings usually have a picture of the finished 3D object in the top right corner,
  which is called an <i>isometric</i> view.
- <i>Orthographic</i> drawings (usually 3) compose most of mechanical drawings and describe
  the top, front, side/right etc. of the object using a 2D drawing.
  - There is no set "top" of a 3D object until it is defined by the engineer who drew the drawing.
  - The bottom is usually the flat part because objects are usually 3D printed and the bottom
    of such objects is flat.

### Sketching

### Importance

- The act of sketching improves spatial visualization skills
  - Just like planning the logic of a program before actually coding,
    hand sketching
- Easy and consistent form of communication/representation

### 2D Sketching

2D sketching is done with orthographic projection and usually consists of a top, front, and side view.
The front view should perfectly align with the top and side views with vertical lines.
A 45 degree line should intersect the straight lines.

The front view is usually on the bottom left corner with the top on the top and side on the right.

### 3D Sketching

Artistic approach:

- Single point projection, which takes perspective into account and kind of "morphs" the object.

Engineering approach:

- Isometrics, since it accurately represents the shape in different orientations
  - Lengths and angles remain the same.
